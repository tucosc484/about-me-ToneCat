## 1.	What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
I am currently a senior at Towson University majoring in computer science. A strong interest in computers as well as software brought me to this major. As I want to eventually work in web development, I decided to take this course as it seemed like it would be helpful and provide reinforcement of web development knowledge I already have. 
## 2.	What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal career progression would be to first graduate from Towson and secure a job. I want to work in the web development field for a few years, before eventually starting my own company or service. Application development has also interested me greatly.
## 3.	What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
In terms of programming experience, I am familiar with Java, C, Objective C, Swift, and JavaScript. I have made several simple HTML websites with JavaScript and CSS, and even have made a couple of more complicated websites involving Node.js backend and MongoDB.
